# Frontend Mentor - Chat app CSS illustration
## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Challenge project picked from https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/chat-app-css-illustration-O5auMkFqY. The project is supposed to be built only in HTML and CSS but i wanted to keep practicing with React and it was an opportunity to use TailwindCSS for the first time.
